                <h2>Welcome to our collaboration space!</h2>
                <p>This website serves as a central location for us to collaborate as a class.Everyone is encouraged to modify the page however you would like. Change the css, the layout, add new functionality, add more content, or suggest changes.</p>
                <br/>
                <p>The benefit here is to learn how to collaborate in a shared codebase. It provides a hands-on experience that is important to have in a professional setting. Additionally it serves as a great piece to share in your portfolio, to show that you have worked on a project with others.</p>
                <br/>
                <h3>Expectations:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Create a branch for your own features and add them in to the main branch through a pull request.</li>
                    <li>Explore concepts and add them to the the website. This can be done by:</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Adding your own page with content and linking it through the navbar</li>
                        <li>Completing a TODO task anywhere in the project</li>
                        <li>Adding new functionality to the website</li>

                    <p><strong>Q.</strong> <i>What if I complete a TODO task someone else has already done or add something we already have?</i></p>
                    <br/>
                    <p><strong>A.</strong> Repeated work is fine, even encouraged. It can be beneficial to see different ways of solving the same problem. This website is not meant to be perfect, just a collaborative sandbox to explore concepts and learn.<br/>If you start something and get stuck, ask someone or add a comment and someone can pick up where you left off.</p>
