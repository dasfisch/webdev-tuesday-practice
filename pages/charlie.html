                The song came and went, like the times that we spent <br>
                Hiding out from the rain under the carnival tent<br>
                Often she'd smile it would last for a while<br>
                You don't know what you've got 'til you lose it all again<br>

                Listen to the mandolin rain, listen to the music on the lake<br>
                Ah, listen to my heart break every time she runs away<br>
                Oh, listen to the banjo wind, a sad song drifting low<br>
                Listen to the tears roll down my face as she turns to go<br>
            </div>
            <div class="stanza">
                A cool evening dance listenin' to the bluegrass band<br>
                Takes the chill from the air until they play the last song<br>
                I'll do my time, oh, keeping you off my mind<br>
                But there's moments that I find, I'm not feeling so strong<br>

                Runnin' down by the lakeshore<br>
                She did love the sound of a summer storm<br>
                It played on the lake like a mandolin<br>
                Now it's washing her away once again, whoa, again<br>

            <div class="stanza">
                The boat's steaming in, oh, I watch the sidewheel spin<br>
                And I think about her when I hear that whistle blow<br>
                I can't change my mind, oh, I knew all the time that she'd go<br>
                That's a choice I made long ago<br>
