            I'm an U.S. Air Force retiree, family man, and passionate technologist based in Lexington, Kentucky. 
            My work is grounded in problem-solving, attention to detail, and a drive to help businesses succeed. 
            Beyond my professional endeavors, I serve as the lead volunteer for all the technology needs at my 
            church, where I manage live streams and maintain tech systems, blending my skills with my love for 
            community service.
